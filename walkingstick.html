       <h1>Walking Stick</h1>
       <p>We believe personalised healthcare can transform patientsâ€™ lives by delivering care tailored to the individual, thereby helping to prevent, diagnose and treat patients more effectively and quickly.
Personalized healthcare is about helping physicians identify patients who may be eligible for appropriate treatment options.
Ultimately, personalized healthcare is about more than medicine: it is a philosophy that guides our approach to research, delivery, and everything in between as we work to improve the lives of patients whom we serve.
A promising trend in healthcare is to move
routine medical checks and other health care services
from hospital to the home environment. With that patients get health care more easily specially in case of emergencies.</p>
<br><p>A system that tries to
remove the curse of blindness and make them selfdependent to do their daily chores. It is a walking stick,
normally used by the blinds. But it is fully automated, easy
to maintain, cheap and it is very comfortable to use.Based on the
strength of vibration of the motor or the beeping of the
buzzer or the blinking of the LED embedded with the stick
a disabled person may determine if he/she is walking
towards a manhole or an edge or a large opening at nearby
bottom or something similar. At the same time he/she may
get the sense of his/her distance from nearby objects and if
he/she is walking in a wet or muddy or potentially
slippery terrain.</p>
<p>This blind aid system can be rendered a
fresh dimension of useful assistance and gives a sense of
artificial vision along with dedicated obstacle and hollow
detection circuitry.</p>
